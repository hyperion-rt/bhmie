This example demonstrates the use of numerical size distributions and multiple
components by reproducing the dust properties for the R_v=3.1 model from Kim,
Martin, and Hendry 1994, ApJ, 422, 164. The size distributions were digitized
from the publication.

To run, use:

    ../../bin/bhmie kmh94_3.1_full.in

In this case, the full dust scattering properties are saved (rather than
assuming Henyey-Greenstein scattering as in the ``kmh94`` model).
