This example demonstrates the use of power-law with exponential decay (PED)
size distributions and multiple components by reproducing the dust properties
for the R_v=3.1 model from Kim, Martin, and Hendry 1994, ApJ, 422, 164, using
a PED approximation to the size distribution.

To run, use:

    ../../bin/bhmie kmh94_3.1_ped.in
